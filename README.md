## :scroll: Description

This is my implementation of the second Jetpack Compose Android Dev Challenge, Jetpack Compause!
It features a functional countdown time, up to 5 minutes. This can be either paused and adjusted, or stopped to reset the countdown.
The background uses Canvas to visually show the countdown.



## :bulb: Motivation and Context

This challenge gave me the chance to use both state and animation with Compose.
State allowed me to both handle the actual timer counting down, as well as managing different states for the timer (counting, paused and stopped).
Animation I was able to apply to the text changing when the timer is counting down, giving it a more engaging UI.
